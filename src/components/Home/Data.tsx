        <p className="home__description">As a recent full-stack software engineering boot camp graduate, my
            proÔ¨Åciency in Python, C, JavaScript, TypeScript, and bash scripting is
            complemented by my adeptness in Flask and React frameworks. My
            familiarity with the Linux environment, MySQL database
            management, and ORM technologies, especially SQLAlchemy, is
            robust. Additionally, my ability to conÔ¨Ågure web servers with
            HAProxy and Nginx underscores my technical versatility. My
            problem-solving skills, gained in the manufacturing industry, enable
            me to approach challenges with a unique perspective, setting me
            apart in the tech Ô¨Åeld.
